# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Sofia.
I'm a full stack software engineer based in Chicago, IL.

Recently, I created Sundial an open-source, open-source cron job monitoring and management system that provides real-time bi-directional communication between the user and registered crontabs on one or multiple nodes. For the developer, Sundial provides alerts of cron jobs failing to run or running abnormally along with any error messages, as well as a a centralized dashboard to edit crontabs from.
